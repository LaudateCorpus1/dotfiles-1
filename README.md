# Matan's Dotfiles

My system configuration and setup using Nix and Nix-Darwin.

## Installation

Run at your own risk:
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matchai/dotfiles/main/install)"
```

## Goals

- [x] Installs Command Line Tools silently
- [x] Installs Nix
- [x] Installs Nix-Darwin
- [x] Installs Homebrew
- [x] Clones this repo to the local machine
- [x] Initiates the first `darwin-rebuild` to switch configurations
